# Cosmic Duality
Project game for intro to game dev 2022 fall semester 


Welcome to COSMIC DUALITY
	This is THE battle between all things good and all things evil, two dual forces in the universe, in a constant struggle.
These cosmic embodiments of the universe, not separate but each other's counterparts. They cannot exist without each other and generate each other.  Battle for eons but experience it all in just a few
minutes. 

Make use of the randomized shot types that change after a short time to attack your opponent as well as the teleport to get the drop on the other player

There are 5 different attack types:
-Balanced 
	-Even attack power and speed
-Power
	-Lots of damage but slow
-Rapid
	-Weak but fast 
-Wall Peirce 
	-Slower and weaker but goes through walls 
-A.O.E.
	-Grows in size over time
